# README for Llama-2-7b Fine-Tuning Project

## Overview

This project is focused on fine-tuning the Llama-2-7b model, a powerful language model by Meta AI, using a unique dataset and advanced techniques like LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) and BitsAndBytes for efficient training and quantization. The project aims to adapt the model to better handle chat-like conversational data, making it more suitable for real-world conversational AI applications.

```
!pip install -q -U peft transformers datasets bitsandbytes trl accelerate wandb
```

## Setting Up the Environment

- Suppress warnings to keep the output clean.
- Hugging Face authentication for accessing private datasets or models.

## Loading the Base Model and Tokenizer

- Llama-2-7b model and tokenizer are loaded using the `transformers` library.
- Quantization config is set for memory efficiency.

## Adding LoRA Adapters

- LoRA adapters are added to the model to enable efficient fine-tuning.
- Adapters target specific modules within the model.

## Loading the Dataset

- `ultrachat` dataset is used, which is specifically designed for chat-like data.

## Training Configuration

- Configurations include batch sizes, optimizer settings, learning rates, etc.
- TrainingArguments from `transformers` are used to encapsulate these settings.

## Formatting Function and SFTTrainer

- A custom formatting function is defined for the dataset.
- SFTTrainer from `trl` is used to handle training logistics.

## Training the Model

- The training process is initiated using the SFTTrainer.
- Model checkpoints and logs are saved at specified intervals.

## Testing Base vs Fine-Tuned Model

- The performance of the base and fine-tuned models are compared using sample inputs.
- This helps in understanding the impact of fine-tuning and adapters.

## Loading the Saved Model

- The fine-tuned model is loaded from Hugging Face's model hub.

## Example Usage

- Demonstration of how to use the fine-tuned model for generating responses.
- Both base and fine-tuned versions are tested to showcase the differences.

## Conclusion

The project illustrates a comprehensive approach to fine-tuning a large language model for specific conversational tasks. The use of advanced techniques like LoRA and quantization demonstrates how to handle large models efficiently. The documentation covers all steps, from setup to training and testing, providing a clear guide for replicating or extending the work.
